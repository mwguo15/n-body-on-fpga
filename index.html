        <p>
          We propose to build a n-body simulator using systolic arrays entirely on an FPGA. Our engine
          will use a connected line of processing elements to feed streaming bodies across the entire
          pipeline, calculating inter-body forces along the way. All data will be stored in the FPGA's
          BRAM and sent back to a PC via UART to verify correctness. For comparison, we will also be
          implementing an optimized n-body simulator on a GPU with CUDA. The goal is to achieve
          comparable or even greater performance with the FPGA by leveraging pipelining, DSP blocks,
          and memory optimizations.

          In n-body simulation, a body's velocity and position are updated every time step to simulate how
          large bodies (planets, stars) interact in our universe. However, these velocity and position
          updates are based on the forces exerted by all other bodies in the system. Sequentially calculating
          all the forces on a single body requires iterating over all the other N - 1 bodies. While this is an extremely parallel algorithm, the
          amount of resources required to execute a fully correct, parallel approach over millions of bodies
          is impractical.

      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <div class="section-content">
        <p>
          As stated previously, the n-body simulation problem is inherently computationally intensive
          because its naive formulation scales quadratically with the number of bodies. Mapping such an
          algorithm onto an FPGA presents several key challenges: computational complexity, precision trade-offs,
          limited memory size, and verification.

            We have chosen to program our FPGA with SystemVerilog and use C++ with CUDA for the
            CPU + GPU implementation. This is because we are most familiar with these languages and they
            are standard for their respective applications.

            Our development and testing will primarily occur on the ECE lab machines in HH1305, which
            are equipped with VCS (Verilog Compiler Simulator) and Intel Quartus (HDL Synthesizer).
            These tools will allow us to simulate our designs for testing and then synthesize our design onto
            the FPGA. If time permits for further optimizations, we will also use the Synopsys Design
            Compiler for critical path, power, and area analysis. As for the FPGA, we will borrow the Altera
            DE2-115 Cyclone IV from a previous professor. Development and testing for the CPU + GPU
            implementation will primarily occur on our personal machines, which are equipped with
            NVIDIA GPUs (an RTX 3060 and an RTX 3070). We will also leverage the GHC lab machines
            with RTX 2080 GPUs for further performance evaluation.

      <div class="section-content">
        <div class="milestone">
          <strong>Week 1 (April 7 - April 13):</strong> In the first week, we will create a minimal, “naive” N-body simulator using SystemVerilog on
          the FPGA. This initial version will compute all pairwise forces by iterating over each body in
          turn, storing positions and velocities in the BRAM for quick access.
        </div>
        <div class="milestone">
          <strong>Week 2 (April 14- April 20):</strong> Our focus will shift to designing and partially integrating the systolic array architecture. We
          will create a pipeline of processing elements (PEs) that pass bodies along in a chain, each PE
          computing the incremental force contribution.
        </div>
        <div class="milestone">
          <strong>Week 3 (April 21- April 28):</strong> In the final week, we will integrate all remaining pieces and verify correctness at scale, pushing
          the design to handle larger numbers of bodies (e.g., 256-1,024, as resources allow). Here, we
          will finalize the numeric format and optimize for performance, monitoring resource utilization
          and possibly clock frequency scaling.
